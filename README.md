Office Hours: Tuesdays, 1pm to 5pm. [Sign up here.](https://www.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUV1dWhzSFpMSVEtfGRlZmF1bHR8ZmY4YTdmODhiM2NjNDQ1NDI4MGRmNjIwNDkzZTBjZjc)

The word "data" is everywhere these days, mostly in reference to just how much of it we are generating, all the time. But once we have this data, how can we create tools that enable us to better understand exactly what it means? This class explores the world of data visualization and representation. We will look at a wide variety of examples, from charts and infographics, to interactive and web-based projects, to abstract, sculptural and more artistic works. Students will also work hands-on with taking raw datasets and translating them into visual outputs that allow the content to be read and understood by a larger audience.

We will use both the Java-based Processing programming environment for desktop and physical projects, as well as JavaScript (mainly the d3 and p5 libraries) for web-based visualizations and design. However, projects using other languages or methods are highly encouraged. There will be weekly assignments, as well as a midterm and final project. No prior programming experience is required, but we will move realtively quickly through programming fundamentals, and some self-study will be required.

By the end of the course, students should understand and be able to utilize the basics of computer programming, as well as demonstrate an ability to take a raw data set and present it in a visual manner.

## Class Expectations  
Participation is very important and will impact grading. In particular, critique will play a large and crucial role in this class. Please pay attention when fellow students are presenting their work and be prepared to give thoughtful, considerate feedback. Keep all feedback related to the work only; personal attacks will not be tolerated.

Laptops and cell phones are not to be used in class, as there are designated computers in the classroom on which to work. Computers are to be used for following along during demos and for individual project work during workshopping days. Please do not use the computers during class discussions or during other students’ project critiques.

Students will be required to post weekly updates and progress on a blog of your choosing: either an existing blog with a specific, class-related tag, or a new blog created especially for the class. Some good resources for blog creation are Wordpress, Tumblr, or Blogger, but any platform may be used as long as it is publicly accessible.

Assignments and projects are due by the beginning of class on the assigned due date. **Please come to class every week prepared to share your work with the group.** A project grade will drop 10% for every day past the due date that it is not turned in.

Attendance is mandatory. More than two (2) unexcused absences will result in automatic failure. Please be prompt to class; lateness of more than ten (10) minutes will count as an unexcused absence unless cleared beforehand.

I am a huge believer in the open source movement, and the idea that the sharing of code and resources is vital to the software world. It's okay to draw inspiration from other developers' work and libraries; most of the time, that's what they're there for. However, it is extremely important that you credit sources and code used that are not your own, and any collaborators you may work with. **Don't take credit for someone else's code. Any plagiarism or uncredited outside contributions found in any work will result in a failing grade on the project.**

I welcome feedback and am eager to hear your thoughts about the class. If something isn’t working for you or you’re feeling behind, do not hesitate to let me know. The sooner I find out about any issues, the sooner I can fix them!

## University Statement on Academic Integrity
A University, by its nature, strives to foster and recognize originality of thought. Originality can only be recognized, however, when people acknowledge the sources of ideas or works that are not their own. Therefore, students must maintain the highest standards with regards to honesty, effort and performance. Violations of academic integrity include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, cheating on exams, false authorship, and destruction of library materials needed for a course. This policy gives definitions and instances of violations of academic integrity, the procedures used to arrive at a judgment, possible sanctions, and the process of appeal. This policy will be enforced rigorously and without discrimination. Please refer to your Student Handbook for a full discussion of the Policy on Academic Integrity.

## Students with Disabilities
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973, all students, with or without disabilities, are entitled to equal access to the programs and activities of Fordham University. The University will make every attempt to provide reasonable accommodations to students who have a documented disability. Students who are seeking accommodation(s) for a disability should contact the Director of Disability Services , Lowenstein Room 207, (212) 636-6282.
