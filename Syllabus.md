## Data Visualization & Representation
#### Fordham College at Lincoln Center
New Media & Digital Design, Fall 2015

<strong>Prof. Roopa Vasudevan</strong>  
Class Time TBD  
Office Hours: TBD  

The word "data" is everywhere these days, mostly in reference to just how much of it we are generating, all the time. But once we have this data, how can we create tools that enable us to better understand exactly what it means? This class explores the world of data visualization and representation. We will look at a wide variety of examples, from charts and infographics, to interactive and web-based projects, to abstract, sculptural and more artistic works. Students will also work hands-on with taking raw datasets and translating them into visual outputs that allow the content to be read and understood by a larger audience.

We will use both the Java-based Processing programming environment for desktop and physical projects, as well as JavaScript (mainly the d3 and p5 libraries) for web-based visualizations and design. However, projects using other languages or methods are highly encouraged. There will be weekly assignments, as well as a midterm and final project. This class will not go over programming fundamentals, so previous knowledge of an object-oriented language is highly recommended.
